# Week 7A Starter Code

This is the starter code for the Week 7A in-class demo (Async Programming & HTTP Requests).

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a new Flutter project in VS Code (use the empty application template)
2. Add the HTTP package: `flutter pub add http`
3. Replace the contents of `lib/main.dart` with the `main.dart` file from this repo
4. **Hot restart** the app (not just hot reload) since we added a new package

## What's Included

The starter code has:
- Basic app structure with StatefulWidget
- An ElevatedButton ready to be wired up
- A Container placeholder (we'll upgrade this to an Expanded widget in class)
- The `http` package imported (but NOT `dart:convert` - we'll add that together)

## In Class

We'll be:
- Testing APIs with Hopscotch (hoppscotch.io) before writing any code
- Learning async/await with a DartPad demo
- Building an async function to fetch data from DummyJSON
- Using the debugger to explore JSON response structure
- Displaying API data in a ListView.builder
- Swapping our Container for Expanded (and understanding why)
- Loading data on startup with initState

## Participation Credit

To get GitHub Classroom participation credit, you can either:
- Commit just your updated `main.dart` file, OR
- Add your entire Flutter project folder

Both options work!
